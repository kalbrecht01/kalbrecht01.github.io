## Initial Inquiry in Post Hathi 45 Fiction ##

# Boundedness and Openness #
The most valuable aspect to the Post45 Hathi Trust Fiction dataset is the volume of works that it makes available to scholars. Not only does this project create a digital archive and work towards preservation/durability, but it also creates metadata to give guidance and a framework for scholarly inquiry.
 
Perhaps the most exciting metadata field through my inquiry is the genres field. This tagging requires a human reading of the dataset to create conceptual categories for each piece of data. This metadata field provides a productive place of inquiry for those interested in genre studies and comparative literature. The points of similarity and discord made possible by this tagging can create productive conversation for scholars on how to type fictions and what might be the limits of that typing.

To that end, in the documentation of the project, I had a hard time finding a schema for how the collectors tagged each genre. Rather than critiquing this omission, I feel that perhaps a schema would have been too rigid or limiting for this type of creative work. To categorize something in genre conventions that change takes a level of expertise. With many different scholars and experts building this database a uniform schema is almost impossible, especially considering the scale of Post45 Hathi Trust Fiction. Also, the origins of the data through Google’s digitization may have influenced these choices and lack of documentation. With “Google-digitized” volumes carrying a genre tag and non-“Google-digitized” versions needing to be hand tagged by experts, perhaps letting these choices go undocumented creates a productive source of mystery to interrogate for scholars. 

To move back to my previous discussion of durability, I appreciate the way that the creators of the dataset imagine the afterlife of this project by providing an open access tsv file for download. Not only can the data be view online it can also be explore on a local machine, regardless of internet access. This can perhaps be in instance of data ethics or data justice when considering that not all scholars interacting with this dataset may have complete an total internet access. This data ethics rings true when the creators not that way that the COVID 19 pandemic has influenced their project and it accessibility. 

They have a branch of their project called “Emergence Temporary Access Service” which 
“permits temporary, emergency access to the collection for member libraries during service disruptions caused by the global pandemic” (Hathi Trust Digital Library). This kind of ethos can allow smaller institutions and library the ability to engage in scholarship despite ongoing global concerns. 

Yet, at the same time, this project is has some boundaries tied to the US, simply because of copywrite issues. While this boundary would be easy to critique, copywrite law is a key hurdle to many DH projects, and I commend the creators for at least making this choice explicit in one of their info-graphics.

# In Conversation with the DH Community #

## Health and Belonging ##

What strikes me about this dataset is the pieces of fiction that are left out, such as early pieces of ficiton. This strikes my particularly as a Early Modernist, because looking at this dataset on might miss out on the vase corpus of fiction before the 20th century. Yet, this omission is due much in part to OCR not yet accurately digitizing older texts and the very real reality of big dick data. Google plays a huge part is what gets counted here, and Google books often do not include older texts in their digitization process.

Digital humanities and data as a healing property is not only explore by D'Ignazio and Klein, but also through Julia Flanders and Trevor Munoz's _An Introduction to Humanities Data Curation_.  Early in their chapter, Flanders and Munoz interogate the process of data curation through definiting these terms for the DH community. They write on the term _curation_ "Etymological guidance from the word's root meaning and early usage gives us the idea of curation as healing, and of the curator as one who 'has the care or chare of a person or thing,' a 'guardian' (OED) (Flander and Munoz). If the curators of Post Hathi Trust 45 Fiction are healers, then perhaps they seek to repair fissures. This dataset has the potential to repair fissures between genres. It has the potential to repair fissures between corporate interests such as Google Books and small institutions who may be struggling in the face of global catastrophy through their Emergency Temporary Access Service. Perhaps the healing the Post Hathi 45 Fiction promises is the health and afterlife of public domain texts--a health gain by bringing individual texts into the fold of a corpus.
