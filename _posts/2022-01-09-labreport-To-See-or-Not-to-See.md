# Post45 HaitiTrust Pivot Table 4: #
_Generally, I had trouble creating charts. I wanted to do two different bar charts, one charting the number of genres by specific genre type another charting the proportion of genre by author birthdate. This would answer two separate questions: which genre is most popular in this specific data set--or more specifically, which genre is most tagged by the creators of this dataset. This is a more complicated question because one data tagger might consider a text historical fiction while another might consider a text domestic fiction. The lines between genres are very blurry and overlapping and this data tries to make those lines seem tidy. I would love to visualize this data as certain bubbles of different sizes for the different frequencies of genres. Then, closely linked genres could be placed near each other to see thematic connections in the tagging. For instance: What is the difference between the novel and love stories? Could they be one and the same? Who gets to make these choices and how are they inconsistent?_

# Post45 HaitiTrust Pivot Table 5: #
In pivot table 5, I charted the biographical information such as at birth/death dates of the authors against the amount of frequency. This data is not quite as tidy, but one can plainly see, in the first 15 entries--the authors with the most hits were born between 1930-1950. So, there is likely a lot of mid to late 20th-century fiction in this dataset. If sorted in the other direction, there are less than 60 authors who were born before the year 1700. As an Early Modernist, this heavily informs my idea of what makes up this database and how useful it might be for my future researchâ€”which, frankly, is minimal. I may not have been able to visualize this as plainly if I had not made the pivot table. 

# Reflections on the Uses and Limitations of Data Visualization: #

**To See or Not to See:**

From working with the Post45 HaitiTrust dataset and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Data, I realize that data is by no means tidy, but that many data scientists want to make it tidy and sensationalized. The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Timelapse https://www.slavevoyages.org/voyage/database#timelapse elicits a very guttural response from me emotionally. It is a prime example of "data visceralization." 

I find data visceralization to be a concerning and fraught subject when it comes to data visualization ethics. Catherine D'Ignazion and Lauren Klien build on existing scholarship when they write about data visceralization in Chapter 3 of their book: "Data Feminism." As media theorist Luke Stark writes: "visceralizations are representations of data that the whole body can experience, emotionally as well as physically" and the text continues, "We are embodied, multisensory beings with cultures and memories and appetites (Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klien). 
 
I would like to close read this. The idea of data creating a bodily experience is certainly attractive but at what cost? Why do we crave or have "appetite" for "multisensory" data images and experiences? Especially when considering the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade timelapse, whose lives are being exploited to provide this experience? For me, this interactive experience both shocked me and enthralled me. The choices of bright colors and fast-moving dots almost turned to the atrocity of the slave trade and the millions of lives lost into an entertainment experience. The spreadsheet, which I recognized is not without biased choices brought me intimately into these numbers in a way that these visualizations did not. But I realize not all audiences will gravitate to the spreadsheet. Where do we go from there?
 
In an era of rampant misinformation, data ethics are more important than ever. This source sets the stakes for how data visualizations can both help us unpack our moment of misinformation and conspiracy theory and also explains to some extent how we have gotten here. Crystal Lee et al, "Viral Visualizations: How Coronavirus Skeptics Use Orthodox Data Practices to Promote Unorthodox Science Online," e-print available at arXiv.org, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07993.pdf. This is important to move from historical and literary studies to current politics especially as I consider starting this pivotal data conversation with undergrads in my classroom.
