Frustration with the Details of Github
======================================

Initial Failure, but Great Hope
-------------------------------

_I enjoyed the tutorial in class on how to make a Github site. The prospect of being about the write durable files that are open access and have an afterlife is extremely intriguing to me. It seems much more ethical than the wordpress site that I currently use, and peaks my curiosity for how I can tranfer or remake my current websites using Github. It also has a lot of pedagogical use by creating an open access, durable course structure beyond the constrictions of blackboard and google drive. I approached lab one with this immense hope, however, I found myself struggling with the technical sides of things, which I have remedied temporarily for the purpose of this lab notebook entry. However, I will have to reture to these snafus later so that my work can be easier for the rest of the course._

# Problems that I encountered #

* forking the my desired Jekyll theme. I found a theme that was aestetically pleasing to me and which I was excited about--alshedivat-al folio. However, when we fored the repo in class I kept getting a 404 error. To remedy this I chose beautiful Jekyll which, after deleting alshedivat, and completing the necessary steps, forked properly! I was able to customize the headers in the _config.yml file and in the index.html file. I also gained practice with writing clear commit messages such as "Updated Header" in the index.html file. Leaving class I felt hopeful. I had a website that was customizable, albeit not the aesthetic that I was hoping for. I had practiced editing posts and adding tags. We were well on our way!
* the second problem that I encountered existed in downloading a Markdown editor for my local computer. I tried Ghostwriter but could not get the zip file to open or run. I actually went onto a couple of repos to find a 64 bit file for Windows 10 to install for Ghostwriter and could not find one or were at a loss as to how to install. I was able to install Markdownpad which is not technically for my operating system. It loaded and I am able to type locally, however the preview feature of the application is broken because I don't have the right intel drivers. The application directed me to a page where I could purchase the intel drivers which I did not do. I even flirted with Typora, but it cost 14 dollars do I decided to forgo this one.
* the way that I remdied these issues is to write in a plain text notepad and copy to Github before commiting.  It is going okay so far but I feel a little blind without a preview window.  In a sense, though I see a silver lining.  Writing in a plain text editor is good practice and will help me learn the syntax of markdown much faster so I am happy with this in the meantime until I am able to fully download a markdown editor locally.


# Goals for the Class-yay! #
_To note, I am a huge planner, dreamer, and big thinker so many of these sentiments may be beyond this class. I will try to delineate between what is achievable in a semester and what is achievable beyond._

**Within the perview of this course:**

* become familiar with markdown and github. Create an online syllabus for a course that I would like to teach on Utopia/Dystopia literature to use as an application for the American Studies Fellowship for Fall 2022. Include a DH component to this class which will hopefully be inspired by our activities and readings.
* read the entirety of Data Feminism and the Digital Black Atlantic to augment my lab notebooks and in preparation for my comprehensive exams.
* create a new but related data set to my current collaborative DH Project (http://earlymodernmaternity.olpekansashistories.com) I would like to create a dataset of early print texts by women in England from 1550-1700 that have to do with spiritual matters, centered around the spiritual autobiography as genre.
* become more patient with myself and accept failure
* cement and augment working relationships with other Early Modernists in the class.

**Beyond the perview of this course:**

* completely fillout my exam list with ten DH texts
* transfer my resume to Github and purchase my own domain name
* start showcasing my writings, student evaluations, and conference presentations in an open access way to prepare for the job market.
