## Answers to Lab Questions

1) By adding back in the stop words to the Cirrus feature of the Humanities data, it is much harder to formulate a research question. Before, students, humanities, and said were the top theree words to appear. I could formulate a basic question such as "what did students say about the humanities?" "Why was talking the preferred form of inquiry and knowledge making?" Does spoken information take precidence in journalistic knowledge-making versus other types of knowledge making?

2) (can you tell me a word that happens a lot within a certain context--relative frequency)- can help isolate specific documents or point out anamolies. 

3) The term MCAS is an acronym for a particular institutional name. It appears in a document which lists alumni from the institution MCAS. The value of the signifigance column shows uniquness and proximity--perhaps an anomoly in a dataset like we have here. This could help in a research question by showing an outlier term or outlier document in the corpus. It provides a good pivot point to compare with the perhaps deceptive cirrus cloud at first glance. 

4) Students is mentioned more in regards to the humanities dataset which could imply that the humanities are more human focused or student centered. Perhaps the hard sciences are more interested in data and knowledge production rather than individual student critical thinking. Said is referenced more in the sciences dataset which could imply that there are more players involved in the hard sciences. More people are doing the talking (there are practically more people in a large science lecture classroom or a in a lab co-authoring a paper). Some more obvious answers include how history is mentioned more in the humanities dataset while science is mentioned more in the science dataset. Overall, I think a main takeaway for me is how the dataset shows the differences between who is involved in knowledge-production between the humanities and the sciences. 

5) I chose to explore the links portion of voyant. On first glance, I could infer that the main point of knowledge-creation from this dataset is narrative--interview and speaking. I was suprised to see "social sciences" as a unique term linked directly to the humanities term. How did voyant assess that "social science" is one unique unit rather than two seperate words? Also tangible, "faculty" was linked to both "students" and to "said." Does the term "faculty" relate to a more collaborative notion--a dialogue with students, while "professor" seems to be some powerhouse of empirical knowledge--only linked to "said." I had hope to find out some very real dissonances between the hard sciences and the humanities from looking at the links tool. However, it showed me how deeply intertwined many of the terms were in this dataset--which is again useful knowledge, just perhaps not as sexy as what I was looking for.

## How to Draw in the Popular Consiousness to our Work:

From this lab, I was able to discover Voyant as a productive place of inquiry for much of my work. Since working with voyant, I have made visualizations of my dissertation prospectus and lit review in progress, a 250 page transcription of a memoir that I am working on, and even a collaborative spreadsheet for my HIS 638 seminar on Monday. What I find so interesting and productive about Voyant is its accessiblity for non-scholarly individuals to a lengthy corpus or text. I was able to show off some of my research to my family using Voyant in a few moment through cirrus. Here, I had an entry point into explaining what we do in the humanities through an aesthetically pleasing visualization that can catch popular attention. This is one of the great strengths of Voyant, and I look forward to using it in the future. However, my future use of Voyant hinges greatly on it remaining open access--an ethos that I am discovering is so pivot to digital work and publishing.

Flanders and Jonnidis in the 2019 work "Data modeling in a digital humanities context" cite Michael Sperberg when he says "modeling is a way to make explicit our assumptions about the nature of a text/artefact," (3). As I reflect on how data modeling can be an accessible and eye-catching entry point into a topic, I am struck by the level of curation that is needed to make models legible and intellectually productive. Data modeling, and research largely, is a balance between top down and bottom up approaches to a text or dataset--expolorative vs. confirmative methods. Voyant draws me in. Data models catch my eye, but I often don't think about the choices and curation behind the schemas that make these models possible. To extend, how can I make not only the process of my DH research legible but also my dissertation research? Making legible all of these choices emphasize process over product and can acknowledge the immense, and often invisible labor behind the kind of research that we do in the humanities and digital humanities. How can we push back against explicit assumptions in the pubic eye about the texts/artefacts that we work on but also the value of our labor. In a world that often prioritizes stem, at least financially, I think it will become more and more important to justify to the popular consiousness why work in the humanities matters. Data modeling is certainly a great entry point, but we cannot stop with the sexy cirrus model. We have to translate that attention grabber into a conversation about the meat of our intellectual work, and I have yet to conceptualize how to do that for myself.
